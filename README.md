# Introduction
C, a company created more than two decades ago, owns several restaurants in Cyprus. These restaurants are grouped into different brands according to the restaurant’s concept, location, and type of cuisine.
One of the first brands created by C, specializing in Asian food, mainly Chinese food, is struggling to maintain its profit margin and continuous growth due to increasing competition and customers’
changes in habits. To try to revert this process, C wants to take advantage of its sales data to understand customers’ patterns of consumption and preferences.
